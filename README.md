## 👋 Introduction

In this project, I explore the dataset provided by Kaggle to build a predictive model for house prices. 

The goal is to apply different regression techniques to achieve the best possible accuracy. 

This project serves as a practical application of my data science skills.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset for this competition can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-data-for-ml-course/data).

It includes various features about houses in Ames, Iowa, such as:

- **MSSubClass**: The building class
- **MSZoning**: The general zoning classification
- **LotFrontage**: Linear feet of street connected to property
- **LotArea**: Lot size in square feet
- And many more...

## 🧠 Models

In this project, I am going to implement several regression models, including:

- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regression
- Random Forest Regression
- Gradient Boosting Regression
